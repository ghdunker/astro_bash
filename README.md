These are some handy scripts for astrology. All of these script use the `date` and `bc` command. 

## Profections:
**profections.sh** takes a birth date (YYYY-MM-DD) and the ascendant (0-11) to give the current profected year.

## Planet Hour:
**planet_hour2.sh** reads current time (hard coded EDT at the moment) and displays the ruling planet for the hour.

## Zodical Releasing:
**select.sh** reads `start-date`, `end-date`, `bith-time`, and the sign (0-11) of `lot of fortune`. It starts output on level one and each selection goes up a level to level four (L4)
